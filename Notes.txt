I'm deciding to store relative coordinates from -4 to 104 for now in 
the Asteroid objects. When drawing them, I will convert them to absolute
coordinates depending on specific canvas pixel position and a scaling factor.

Scaling factors:
    For Large Asteroid: size = 8
    For Medium Asteroid: size = 4
    For Small Asteroid: size = 2
    For Ship: 2

The Scaling factor will determine how many relative length units a side 
lenght of a bounding box of the object's length should take up.
