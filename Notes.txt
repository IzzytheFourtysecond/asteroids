I'm deciding to store relative coordinates from -8 to 108 for now in 
the Asteroid objects. When drawing them, I will convert them to absolute
coordinates depending on specific canvas pixel position and a scaling factor.

Scaling factors:
    For Asteroid: 2 ** asteroid.size;
    For Ship: 1

The Scaling factor will determine how many relative length units a side 
lenght of a bounding box of the object's length should take up.
