I'm deciding to store relative coordinates from -4 to 104 for now in 
the Asteroid objects. When drawing them, I will convert them to absolute
coordinates depending on specific canvas pixel position and a scaling factor.

Scaling factors: (size = 2 * scaling factor)
    For Large Asteroid: 8
    For Medium Asteroid: 4
    For Small Asteroid: 2
    For Ship: 2

The Scaling factor will determine how many relative length units a side 
lenght of a bounding box of the object's length should take up.

xPos and yPos should be the only attributes of an asteroid changed.
