I'm deciding to store relative coordinates from -4 to 104 for now in 
the Asteroid objects. When drawing them, I will convert them to absolute
coordinates depending on specific canvas pixel position and a scaling factor.

Scaling factors: (asteroid.size = 2 * scaling factor)
    For Large Asteroid: 8
    For Medium Asteroid: 4
    For Small Asteroid: 2
    For Ship: 2

The Scaling factor will determine how many relative length units a side 
lenght of a bounding box of the object's length should take up.

xPos and yPos should be the only attributes of an asteroid changed.

Try creating the player by themselves before trying to get them to interact 
with asteroid objects.

Assuming the ship is oriented like this "A", the coordinates of its important 
points are: 
    (x, y)

    body:
    (0, -1)
    (-0.25, 0)
    (0.25, 0)
    (-0.4, 0.6)
    (0.4, 0.6)
    (-0.5, 1)
    (0.5, 1)

    flame:
    (-0.2, 0.6)
    (-0.2, 0.6)
    (0, 1)

Use a matrix rotation to find the coordinates of the points of the ship.

Idea for storing players in memory:
    Keep all players drawn on screen in same global array named lives. 
    However, only give the player control over the first one and only 
    update the first one's kinematics.

OK the relative coordinates make the ship look awful when rotating. They 
need to be changed... Maybe the y coordinates can have valid relative 
coordinates from -8 to 125 with 0 to 119 being on screen?
Maybe spawning the asteroids can stay on the old coordinates?
Maybe its not worth changing?

How bullet velocity is being calculated:
    v_hat = [tip of player ship] - [player position]; // a unit vector...

    v_bullet = ((0.5 * (v_hat â‹… [ship's old velocity])) + 20) * v_hat;

Idea for implementing collisions later: 
    call updateKinematics many times per frame...

MAJOR TODO...
How do you account for the edge case of an object looping the screen during
collision check... I think the solution is to just not and disable collision 
in that specific instance...
